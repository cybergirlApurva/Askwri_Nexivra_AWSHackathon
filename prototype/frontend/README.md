# AskWRI frontend: the globe

A minimalist Vite + Three.js interface for the AskWRI backend (`../backend`). Ask a question and the places named in the cited WRI sources appear as pins on a real 3D Earth. Click a pin for an at-a-glance summary and follow-up questions, or open a full briefing.

## Run it

Two terminals, from the repo root. Node 22.12 or newer.

```bash
# 1. backend (see ../backend; DEMO_MODE=true in .env serves clearly labeled sample data)
cd prototype/backend && source .venv/bin/activate && python -m uvicorn app:app --port 8001

# 2. frontend
cd prototype/frontend && npm ci && npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
```

Vite forwards `/api/*` to `http://127.0.0.1:8001`. Use another port with `ASKWRI_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 npm run dev`. AWS credentials stay in the backend; the browser never sees them.

To serve everything from the backend instead: `npm run build`, and the backend serves `dist/` at `http://127.0.0.1:8001/`.

## What it does

- **Globe:** a WebGL Earth with bundled textures (no CDN). Drag to rotate, scroll or pinch to zoom, arrow keys and `+`/`-` work when it has focus. Every camera move is eased; idle rotation resumes 5 seconds after you let go.
- **Pins:** each place named inside a cited passage becomes a pin. Pins are real buttons (keyboard-focusable, labelled). Pins close together merge into a count badge; click it to zoom in. Pins on the far side of the globe fade out. The places are also listed as buttons in the answer panel.
- **Glance card:** clicking a pin opens a card docked **beside** the globe, never over it, joined to the pin by a thin leader line. Click another pin and the card swaps in place, so you can move through many pins quickly. The card shows the issues from your answer, a cited summary from WRI sources only, a follow-up box, and a "Full briefing" link that opens a new tab.
- **Panels never cover the globe:** when the answer panel or card opens, the globe shifts and zooms out just enough to stay fully visible in the free space.
- **Briefing page:** `briefing.html?place=…&topic=…` shows an overview, key findings and related publications, all cited. The topic in the link is the PII-masked question from the server, never the raw text.
- **Connections view:** an Obsidian-style map. Topic hubs link to publications; dashed lines link publications that share title terms (hover a line to see why); gold rings mark sources cited in your latest answer. Drag nodes, scroll to zoom, double-click to refit.
- **Languages:** English, Español, Português, Français, Bahasa Indonesia, हिन्दी and 中文, picked beside the question box (and in the briefing header). The whole interface switches in place and the choice is remembered. Answers come back written in that language by the model, while every quote stays word for word in the source's original language with a labeled machine translation underneath, so the evidence can still be checked. Switching language with an answer on screen offers to re-run it. Briefing links carry `?lang=`. Sample-data mode can't translate (its passages are canned English) and says so.
- **Demand Radar:** questions asked here feed the team's Radar page (`/radar`), with an optional team label. The answer panel says when a question was logged. See the root README.
- **Honest states:** loading, refusal ("insufficient evidence"), out-of-scope, errors with retry. A permanent banner marks sample data. The UI never fabricates an answer.
- **Accessibility:** skip link, live-region announcements, reduced-motion support, keyboard operation. Phones get bottom sheets instead of side panels.

Without WebGL the globe shows a message; search, answers, the places list and briefings still work.

## Tests

```bash
npm test            # 41 unit/UI tests (jsdom, no browser needed), incl. translation checks
npm run build       # production bundle

# Optional: real Chrome end-to-end check with REAL mouse clicks on pins.
# Needs the backend running in demo mode on :8001 and `npm run build` first.
node tests/e2e-browser.mjs          # set CHROME=/path/to/chrome if not on macOS
```

`tests/geo.test.mjs` proves the latitude/longitude math against real three.js sphere vertices, so a pin cannot land on the wrong continent. `tests/app.test.mjs` drives the UI with a fake globe and API, including stale-response and XSS cases. The Chrome check saves screenshots to `node_modules/.cache/e2e/`.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `index.html`, `briefing.html` | The two pages (Vite multi-page build) |
| `src/main.js` | Creates the globe and starts the app |
| `src/app.js` | Controller: ask flow, panels, layout, status, view switching |
| `src/globe.js` | The WebGL Earth, camera flights, pin projection, panel fitting |
| `src/pins.js` | Pin buttons, clustering, far-side fade |
| `src/glance.js` | The docked card, summary, follow-ups |
| `src/graph.js` | The connection map (canvas + `d3-force`) |
| `src/render.js` | Cited claims and sources (all text via `textContent`) |
| `src/i18n.js`, `src/locales/*.js` | Interface translation. `en.js` is the source of truth; every locale must have the same keys (`tests/i18n.test.mjs`) |
| `src/api.js`, `src/util.js`, `src/geo.js` | Backend client, small helpers, lat/lon math |
| `src/styles.css` | All styling |

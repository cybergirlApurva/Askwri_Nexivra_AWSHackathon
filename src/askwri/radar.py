"""Demand Radar: log questions AskWRI can't answer well and turn them into a ranked list of gaps.

Three kinds of "no good answer", each with a different owner and action:
  not_loaded       found in the WRI catalog but not in the searchable corpus -> Data Lab loads it
  weak             answered thinly, or WRI has the report but it didn't answer -> update/extend research
  never_published  no match in the catalog                                   -> possible new research area

Storage is SQLite (RADAR_DB, default data/radar.db). No names or user ids are stored: only the
question (emails and phone numbers removed), an optional team label, and the retrieval outcome.
